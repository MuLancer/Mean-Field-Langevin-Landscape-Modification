# Mean Field Langevin Dynamics: Noise Particle Gradient Descent with Landscape Modification

This project explores various optimization strategies on image classification tasks using both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. We compare standard methods (SGD, Adagrad) with modified versions that incorporates landscape modification developed by Choi to improve performance. We introduce a heuristic that leverages the average behavior of multiple particles to scale the gradients in landscape modification, thereby balancing exploration and exploitation by exploiting particle interactions.
